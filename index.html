        <h1>Elevator pitch</h1>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Main ideas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mobile is much less predictable than desktop.
          <li>There are <b><i>tens of thousands</i></b> of devices that can connect to the internet, each with unique capabilities.
          <li>We must build for all, instead of optimizing for one or two.
          <li>Simple and universal is the best approach.
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Native apps</h3>
        <ul class="build">
          <li>Some phones have their own platform to build apps.
          <li>You may have heard of: iPhones, Android, WebOS
          <li>Building "apps" takes longer, requires more expertise, and <b>costs more</b>.
          <li>Your app will look and feel like part of the phone.
          <li>Each user must download the app before using it.
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Mobile websites</h3>
        <ul class="build">
          <li>All can access the web equally!
          <li>Building a website is faster, free to learn, and cheaper!
          <li>A well-built mobile site is an "on-demand app" - it loads immediately when you visit a URL.
          <li>Small downside: looks weird on desktop, so you have to build a website for each.
          <li>Much cheaper than apps.
        </ul>
        <!-- p>Example: <a href="http://m.nbcsports.com">NBC Sports</a></p -->
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Responsive websites</h3>
        <ul class="build">
          <li>A way of merging your desktop and mobile website into one package.
          <li>More work than a simple mobile site, but also more flexible.
          <li>Handles the most diverse set of devices (like tablets)
          <li>Still cheaper than apps.
        </ul>
