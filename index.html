        <h1>Elevator pitch</h1>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Main ideas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mobile is much less predictable than desktop.
          <li>There are <b><i>tens of thousands</i></b> of devices that can connect to the internet, each with unique capabilities.
          <li>We must build for all, instead of optimizing for one or two.
          <li>Simple and universal is the best approach.
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h1>Mobile experiences</h1>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Native apps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some phones have their own platform to build apps.
          <li>You may have heard of: iPhones, Android, WebOS
          <li class="pro">Your app will look and feel like part of the phone.
          <li class="con">Building native apps takes longer, requires more expertise, and <b>costs more</b>. (Pay for each version)
          <li class="con">Each user must download the app before using it.
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Mobile websites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="pro">All can access the web equally
          <li class="pro">Building a website is faster, free to learn, and cheaper!
          <li class="pro">A well-built mobile site is an "on-demand app" - it loads immediately when you visit a URL.
          <li class="pro">Much cheaper than apps. Many CMSs have drop-in solutions.
          <li class="con">Can look odd on desktop, so you have to build a website for each, and redirect.
        </ul>
        <p>Examples: <a href="http://m.cnn.com">m.cnn.com</a>, <a href="http://m.nbcsports.com">m.nbcsports.com</a></p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Responsive websites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A way of packaging your desktop and mobile websites together. The website is built to <b>respond</b> to the device that displays it. Can be based on screen size, GPS, or dozens of other device features.
          <li class="pro">Handles the most diverse set of devices (including phones, tablets, TVs, projectors...)
          <li class="con">Some kinks have not yet been worked out, like how to handle IAB and other advertising standards.
        </ul>
